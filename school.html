        <h2>School Life</h2>

        <hr>

        <p>
            In school, I always put as much effort as I can into everything I do. I've taken as many AP/IB classes as I can while also maintaining a good amount of classes related to my future intended major, Computer Science. Furthermore, I play the violin in my high school orchestra, chamber group and jazz orchestra club as a first violin. In addition, I am in my school's Key Club, Coding Club, and National Honor Society Chapter. I have a weighted GPA of about 100.4, and I am 20th in my class of 424 students. Ever since I was a child, my academics have always been extremely important to me. I value the rigor of hard work and challenge myself to achieve more whenever possible. It's a difficult task to balance school work with all of the extracurriculars and volunteering I do, but it's one I feel I've been able to learn to manage well.
