        <h2>The Councils</h2>

        <hr>

        <p>
            Throughout my high school career, I've always valued the ability to play a role in the decisions made by the student government. Whether it's being the Vice-President of my class, or being a student representative on the council, I do what I can to help out and be a leading and active member in my school. Being in the student council has taught me many lessons in the areas of organizing events, fundraising money, and being able to step up and lead a group of people to success. We've organized countless events and fundraisers for our school, and often find ways to benefit our community while we're at it! I love being on the Senior Council currently, and as we are hard at work making sure our Senior Ball is as magical as it can be!
