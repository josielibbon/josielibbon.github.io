        <h2>Science Olympiad</h2>

        <hr>

        <p>
            I decided to join Science Olympiad Club my senior year, and it's already turning out to be a very fun and exciting experience! I have been elected as the Treasurer of the club, so I'm currently putting together a fundraiser that should raise us around $500 to pay for next season's competitions in advance. I currently participate in 4 events, including Chemistry Lab, Codebusters, Simple and Compound Machines and Detector Building. At the time I am writing this, we've only participated in one invitational so far. But, at that invitational I got first place out of 21 teams in one of my events, and our team placed sixth overall! All in all, this club is turning out to be a great learning and leadership experience that I'm very happy to be a part of.
