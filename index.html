            Hi, my name is Josie Libbon! Welcome to my website, completely coded by me using HTML and CSS. I took the initiative to learn how to code at the age of 15, and this website is the product. Here, I showcase my extracurriculars and volunteering, and have a gallery of photos illustrating amazing opportunities I have taken part in. In a nutshell, I'm a persistent and dedicated girl who spends her free time learning about technology and training in the art of dance.

        <p>
            I participate in many after-school activities. First, I am the Vice-President of my class. As VP, I take point on organzing school events and fundraisers, and co-lead the student council. It's an amazing experience, and from it I gained many leadership skills that are very helpful in my everyday life, such as public-speaking, and working well in groups. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to being VP, I am in my high school's volunteering club, called Key Club. There, I have been exposed to many opportunities for helping my community, and volunteering in many different school events. I am also in stage crew, where I help put on my school's plays, concerts, and musicals. Furthermore, I am a part of in my school's French club, where we learn about French culture outside of French class.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Also, I started my high school's first all-girls robotics team! We are going to participate in many competitions, and we're super excited and proud to have made an opportunity for ourselves!

            I've accumulated over 100 hours of volunteering in my years at high school so far. Every year, I volunteer to be in a production called "Dasher's Magical Gift." Many hours are spent in rehearsals to make the show as entertaining as possible for the audience of about 5000 adults and kids. It is sponsored by a non-profit organiszation called CNY Art's, and was made to introduce kids to the art of dance, music, and acting. School districts from all over the area send their elementary students to enjoy the show as a field-trip around Christmas time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also volunteer to perform in the "Symphoria: Holiday Pops" concerts. Symphoria is the official symphony of Syracuse, and as they play holiday music, I am one of the dancers that dance in front of them to entertain the audience of about 5000 people each show.
