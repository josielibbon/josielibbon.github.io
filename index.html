            Hi, my name is Josie Libbon! Welcome to my website, completely coded by me using HTML and CSS. I took the initiative to learn how to code at the age of 15, and this website is the product. Here, I showcase my extracurriculars and volunteering, and have a gallery of photos illustrating amazing opportunities I have taken part in. In a nutshell, I'm a persistent and dedicated girl who spends her free time learning about technology and training in the art of dance.

            I participate in many after-school activities. First, I was the Vice-President of my class in my sophmore year of high school. As VP, I took point on organizing school events and fundraisers, and co-led the student council. It was an amazing experience, and from it I gained many leadership skills that are very helpful in my everyday life, such as public-speaking, and working well in groups. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to being VP, I am in my high school's volunteering club, called Key Club. There, I have been exposed to many opportunities for helping my community, and volunteering in many different school events. I am also in stage crew, where I help put on my school's plays, concerts, and musicals. Furthermore, I was a part of in my school's French club, where we learn about French culture outside of French class. Also, I have recently joined gardening club, which has so far been such a fun and memorable time, as we all work together to grow a beautiful garden of fruits and vegetables to later donate to our local food pantry.
        </p> 
        <p>
            Also, I started my high school's first all-girls robotics team! We have to participated in many competitions, and we're super excited and proud to have made this opportunity for ourselves! In just our first year, we made it to the New York State Vex Robotics Championships. I have also been elected as the Webmaster of the Robotics club, which means I am responsible for creating and maintaining a great website for our club.

            I've accumulated over 100 hours of volunteering in my years at high school so far. Every year, I volunteer to be in a production called "Dasher's Magical Gift." Many hours are spent in rehearsals to make the show as entertaining as possible for the audience of about 5000 adults and kids. It is sponsored by a non-profit organization called CNY Art's, and was made to introduce kids to the art of dance, music, and acting. School districts from all over the area send their elementary students to enjoy the show as a field-trip around Christmas time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also volunteer to perform in the "Symphoria: Holiday Pops" concerts. Symphoria is the official symphony of Syracuse, and as they play holiday music, I am one of the dancers that dance in front of them to entertain the audience of about 5000 people each show. I am so honored to take part in these shows that bring so much joy and holiday spirit to Syracuse!
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, I volunteered as a counselor for GEMS Camp here in Bville, a fun summer program for girls in 5th-7th grade who want to learn about engineering. There, I helped them learn how to code and drive robots, and showed them that girls are capable of doing amazing things in the technology field!
